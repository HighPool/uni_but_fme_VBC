# Bio-inspired computing

## Objective of the course – aims of the course unit:
Goal of the course is to introduce students to modern tools of biology inspired computing and options and appropriate usage for solving engineering tasks.

## Knowledge: 
Students will know basic principles and algorithms of presented methods usable in continuous and combinatorial optimization and their options, restrictions and potential for implementation.

## Skills: 
Ability to use these methods to solve practical engineering problems where methods of mathematical optimization may not provide acceptable results.

## Prerequisites:
Statistics and Optimization Methods I.

## Course contents (annotation):
The course introduces basic and advanced methods of so called biology inspired computing. Focus is on practical implementation of this special class of artificial intelligence algorithms. Usability of the methods is demonstrated with mathematical and engineering problems.
